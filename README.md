# Reactive Event Bus

Reactive Event Bus is a javascript library event bus.

## Motivation
Imagine having a large scale application containing a lot of components interacting with each other, and we want a way to make your components communicate while maintaining loose coupling and separation of concerns principles. The Event Bus pattern can be a good solution for our problem.

Implementing an Event Bus pattern can be beneficial for our code base as it helps loose coupling your classes and promotes a publish-subscribe pattern. It also help components interact without being aware of each other. Whichever implementation we choose to follow is a matter of taste and requirements. The main idea behind it is that we can connect two objects/two classes that have different lifecycles or a very different hierarchy or items dependency in the simplest way possible. Thatâ€™s all.



## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

In order to be able to use the methods in our components you should import them from '@gk-software/component-runtime-rx-event-bus';

```python
import { on, emit, Subscribe } from 'reactive-event-bus';


on('GetSomethingMessage').subscribe(() => {})

on('GetSomethingMessage').pipe(debounceTime(2000))subscribe(() => {})

emit({ type: 'GetSomethingMessage', data: { something: 'someValue'}});

Developers forget to unsubscribe messages
Naturally we are not machines. 
So why not create a subscribe decorator that internally automagically unsubscribes
the all messages in the disconnectedCallback lifecycle ?

@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage')
 onGetSomething(config) {
  // do something
}

In case the developer just want to receive the first data of the subscription,
should pass the option: {once: true}. 
So after the first subscription, is automatically unsubscribed.

@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage', {once: true})
  onGetConfigsDetails(config: any) {
   // do something
}

In case the developer want to preserve the state of the messages,
 so even if you emit before of the subscribe and you want to get the data, 
should pass the option: { state: true }, so it will save the state of the message for the futures subscribers.

@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage', {state: true})
  onGetSomething(config) {
   // do something
}
```
