# Reactive Event Bus

Reactive Event Bus is a typescript library event bus.

## Motivation
Imagine having a large scale application containing a lot of components interacting with each other, and we want a way to make your components communicate while maintaining loose coupling and separation of concerns principles. The Event Bus pattern can be a good solution for our problem.

Implementing an Event Bus pattern can be beneficial for our code base as it helps loose coupling your classes and promotes a publish-subscribe pattern. It also help components interact without being aware of each other. Whichever implementation we choose to follow is a matter of taste and requirements. The main idea behind it is that we can connect two objects/two classes that have different lifecycles or a very different hierarchy or items dependency in the simplest way possible. Thatâ€™s all.



## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

In order to be able to use the methods in our components you should import them from 'reactive-event-bus';

```python
import { on, emit, Subscribe } from 'reactive-event-bus';
```

1. Register to events

Option 1

```python
on('GetSomethingMessage').subscribe(() => {})
```
Note: on() returns an observable so you pipe any operator on top of the returned observable.
on('GetSomethingMessage').pipe(debounceTime(2000))subscribe(() => {})

Option 2

**NOTE: To use this option you must have declared on your component file the lifecycles which will be overriden by the decorator: (React - componentDidMount/componentWillUnmount, Angular - ngOnInit/ngOnDestroy, VanillaCustomElement/StencilJS - connectedCallback/disconnectedCallback).**

Motivation for this option: Developers forget to unsubscribe messages
Naturally we are not machines. So why not create a subscribe decorator that internally automagically unsubscribes
the all messages in the destroy lifecycle disconnectedCallback/ngOnDestroy/componentWillUnmount (depending in which framework is being used) ?

The good thing about this option is that the developer does not need to handle the unsubscription of the event as it happens with the on().

```python
@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage')
 onGetSomething(config) {
  // do something
}
```

1.1. Additional options when registering to events

In case the developer just want to receive the first data of the subscription,should pass the option: {once: true}. 
So after the first subscription, is automatically unsubscribed.

```python
on('GetSomethingMessage', {once: true})).subscribe(() => {})

# or

@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage', {once: true})
  onGetSomething(config) {
   // do something
}

```

In case the developer want to preserve the state of the messages,so even if you emit before of the subscribe and you want to get the data, should pass the option: { state: true }.
Therefore, it will save the state of the message for the futures subscribers.


```python
on('GetSomethingMessage', {state: true})).subscribe(() => {})

or 

@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage', {state: true})
  onGetSomething(config) {
   // do something
}
```

In case the developer want to emit the first value and then ignore emitted values for a specified duration should pass the option: { throttleTime: durationTime }.

```python
on('GetSomethingMessage', { throttleTime: 1000 })).subscribe(() => {})

# or 

@Subscribe('GetSomethingMessage', { throttleTime: 1000 })
  onGetSomething(config) {
   // do something
}
```

2. Dispatching events
```python
emit({ type: 'GetSomethingMessage', data: { something: 'someValue'} })
```

## Tests
```python
npm run test
```
